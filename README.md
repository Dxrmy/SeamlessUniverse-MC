**SeamlessUniverse** redefines the spatial architecture of Minecraft. Moving beyond standard portals, it creates a vertically unified world where dimensions exist as literal layers of the universe.

## The Vertical Design
- 🌑 **The Nether Below**: The Nether is now the literal foundation of the world, located far beneath the Overworld's bedrock.
- 🏛️ **The Aether Above**: Built-in compatibility with the Aether mod, placing the heavenly islands directly in the sky above the Overworld.
- 🌌 **The End / The Abyss**: The End exists as a terrifying abyss, reminiscent of the "Upside Down," waiting beneath the deepest shadows.
- ⚡ **Seamless Transitions**: Move between these layers without loading screens, creating a single, continuous world.
